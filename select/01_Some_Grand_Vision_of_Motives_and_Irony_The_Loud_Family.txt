I try to live up to the times I've seen
But I'm feeling broke and seventeen
Reduced to things I have to do
Always the eyes, never the view

They say that you're not really choosing me
You're biding time and using me
But if that's why you're here
Girl, I don't mind
Come back next year

Wake up one day
'Cause I got no other way to make you need me
Wake up one day
And it's not your job to make things easy
Wake up one day
With some grand vision of motives and irony
And no one in love with me

I stood on tried and true philosophies
When I should've been down on my knees
You push and I feel like I should shove
And are we gonna be left with anything like love?

Wake up one day
'Cause I got no better way to make you need me
Wake up one day
And it's not your job to make things easy
Wake up one day
With some grand vision of motives and irony
And no one in love with me
